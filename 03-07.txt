[13:30] <balaji> Balaji
[13:30] <Cyber_freak> Hi thebigj
[13:30] <sayan> People who will do top posting in mailing list will be removed from the mailing list
[13:30] <realslimshanky> sayan, git pull ;)
[13:31] <sayan> So, keep that in mind.
[13:31] <Padfoot7> Roll Call: Mohd Omama
[13:31] <sayan> Any queries from last session? I will just take questions for next 5 mins
[13:31] <__anshul__> who will do top posting in mailing list ?
[13:31] <__anshul__> "top posting"?
[13:32] <ashwanig> __anshul__, Read this http://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/communication.html#mailing-list
[13:32] <sayan> __anshul__: read what ashwanig shared
[13:32] <andodococo> Roll call: Deepak Chethan
[13:32] <avik_> __anshul__: it is the time when people reply to a mail, above the main mail
[13:32] <vipulgupta2048_> !
[13:32] <sayan> next
[13:33] <devesh_V> Roll call: Devesh Verma
[13:33] <__anshul__> okay
[13:33] <deepika> !
[13:33] <sayan> next
[13:33] <deepika> is their any way to recover a quit with discard changes file in vim like restore session from 2 hours prior /does *.swp files contain those files too in vim or does it just contain those files that we quitted ?
[13:33] <vipulgupta2048_> sayan,I tried implementing markdown in various platforms but it seems it is different in other places ( the syntax). Is it not standard ?
[13:34] <__anshul__> vim, has swapfiles, see if you've enabled it
[13:34] <vipulgupta2048_> Example would be wordpress, some elements didn't work
[13:34] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: there is no clear standard for Markdown, but the basic elements remain the same
[13:35] <sayan> deepika: you can recover as long as there is *.swp file
[13:35] <im_mohsin> vipulgupta2048_, I wrote a blog post using Markdown and it worked completely fine to me
[13:35] <vipulgupta2048_> sayan, So I can refer to the cheat-sheet for each one , I think that would be better
[13:35] <sayan> deepika: when you open a file it's opens a swp file, you can recover from it
[13:35] <vipulgupta2048_> im_moshin, did every element worked the way it should ?
[13:35] <sayan> whatever is in there
[13:36] <__anshul__> @deepika http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/recover.html
[13:36] <im_mohsin> vipulgupta2048_, it worked correctly and i'm using wordpress

[13:37] <sayan> *- One fine day, you plan to start a project of yours.
[13:37] <sayan> *- But maintaining and building a project is nevertheless a daunting task

[13:38] <sayan> *- But, you are just a developer and at the end of the day a human.
[13:38] <theAtom> Roll Call: deep
[13:38] <sayan> *- You are ought to make mistakes, forget corner cases, make bunch of typos.
[13:39] <sayan> *- and all the other issues that you never even thought of.
[13:39] <sayan> *- But, that's when the community comes to rescue. They start filing up issues.
[13:39] <sayan> *- You solve them one by one. But. slowly, slowly, slowly.
[13:39] <sayan> *- Your issues counter has reached 1000.
[13:40] <sayan> *- Would you be celebrating this milestone? If I were you. I would be tensed.
[13:40] <pr97> roll call:Priyanka Sharma
[13:40] <sayan> *- There so much work years to spend just to fix those pending issues.
[13:40] <sayan> *- You wished you had a helping hand and the community who were just filing the issues
[13:41] <sayan> *- with comments "How can we help?" could just come and help you out.
[13:41] <sayan> *- And with a tensed mind, you mistakenly forcefully delete an important chunk of code.
[13:41] <sayan> *- *And your nightmare dream sequence breaks*
[13:42] <sayan> *- Sweating profusely, You thank your god for the blessing in disguise.
[13:42] <sayan> *- You take an oath for each of your project you will be using a Version Control System a.k.a VCS

[13:45] <sayan> *- Next day morning you start reading VCS, scratching your head to get around with all the terms
[13:46] <Vamsi3296> Roll call - Vamsi Krishna
[13:46] <sayan> *- The first one that you hit is commits, so what is commit (or snapshot?)
[13:47] <sayan> *- So you thought of writing a series analogy stories to learn the concepts better :)
[13:47] <sayan> *- You create a new character, Tux
[13:47] <sayan> *- Tux wants to be photographer, who has just bought a new DSLR.
[13:48] <sayan> *- Tux plan to be the next travel photographer, who would take the best picture from the top of Mt. Everest
[13:49] <sayan> *- But Tux is a newbie, so Tux starts watching for YouTube tutorials for learning to post process the images.
[13:49] <sayan> *- Tux creates a directory named *working* to put all un-processed images. <<-- mind *working* is to be focused here
[13:50] <sayan> *- Then, fires up DarkTable to process the images.
[13:50] <sayan> *- Every time after a set of similar operations (like crop & rotate, shadows & highlights, etc), Tux creates a copy of the *working* directory and names it `snapshot-{n}`
[13:51] <sayan> *- After a couple of operations, Tux stands having "snapshot-1", "snapshot-2", "snapshot-3", .... , "snapshot-100" directories.
[13:52] <sayan> *- This directories is history of how Tux developed the image over time. At any point, Tux can go back to a given snapshot and build again on top of it.

[13:54] <sayan> *- *Chapter 2: Understanding VCS: Staging Area*
[13:54] <championshuttler> no
[13:55] <sayan> *- It's been a month now, Tux have learned a lot on post-processing images.
[13:55] <sayan> *- Tux now mixes and matches multiple images file to create a snapshot directory.
[13:56] <sayan> *- One day, Tux while processing the images, goes into experimental mode.
[13:56] <sayan> *- and only after a while realized that the changes should be going into two
[13:57] <sayan> *- different snapshot directories (`snapshot-139` & `snapshot-140`).
[13:57] <sayan> *- Smart Tux quickly thought of an idea, creates a new staging directory.
[13:58] <sayan> *- A staging directory works as an intermediate between the working directory
[13:58] <sayan> *- and the snapshot directory.
[13:58] <devendrabhat> #attendance Devendra Bhat
[13:58] <sayan> *- So, Tux now works on working directory, and one Tux is happy with the changes
[13:59] <sayan> *- Tux moves all changed files into staging directory, and then creates a copy of the staging directory as new snapshot directory
[13:59] <sayan> Any question till here?
[13:59] <jasonbraganza> none
[13:59] <championshuttler> no
[14:00] <asraisingh> !
[14:00] <sayan> Cool
[14:00] <anupamas> no
[14:00] <soumam007__> !
[14:00] <sayan> next
[14:00] <sayan> next
[14:00] <vsnehil> no
[14:00] <asraisingh> is the staging directory is the copy of snap directory
[14:00] <asraisingh> ?
[14:00] <balaji> !
[14:00] <avik_> nope
[14:00] <soumam007__> how many directories are existing distinctly?
[14:00] <soumam007__> 2 or 3?
[14:01] <saikat_> !
[14:01] <asraisingh> sayan, or staging directory is an hypothetical directory?
[14:01] <navneet> !
[14:02] <sayan> asraisingh: soumam007_: you working on the working directory, once done with changes move the changes to staging, and the finally create snapshot from staging
[14:02] <cignatious> 3 i guess
[14:02] <im_mohsin> sayan, power cut here. did i miss a lot. I'm getting any messages
[14:02] <sayan> asraisingh: 3 for now
[14:02] <asraisingh> sayan, got it
[14:02] <championshuttler> !
[14:02] <sayan> asraisingh: yes, hypothetical, should be more clear when we do hands-on next
[14:02] <sayan> next
[14:02] <sayan> next
[14:03] <sayan> next
[14:03] <balaji> Is staging area overwrites the existing one or it will create a new one?
[14:03] <saikat_> Is this staging area basically like a clipboard/buffer area?
[14:03] <navneet> Does staging area occupy extra space or memory
[14:03] <soumam007__> ok
[14:04] <sayan> batul: new one, you move your changes in there
[14:04] <soumam007__> but why not from working to snapshot directly?
[14:04] <championshuttler> is snapshot final directory?
[14:05] <sayan> saikat_: an area before the final snapshot/or commit creation
[14:05] <sayan> next
[14:05] <sayan> next
[14:05] <championshuttler>  is snapshot final directory?
[14:06] <im_mohsin> soumam007__, There are times when you don't want to commit little changes to directly. Staging act as intermediary where you club all the small commits and then send it from as a one commit
[14:06] <sayan> championshuttler: yes, directory is a hypothetical VCS theory, you will understand more during hands-on
[14:07] <sayan> im_mohsin: I did not answer soumam007__ because soumam007__ was out of turn

[14:16] <saikat_> just the email in the triangle brackets?

[14:18] <sayan> next
[14:18] <vipulgupta2048_> Why did we do, what we just did ?  Like to just sum up, if you were going to explain that,ignore
[14:19] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: yes, I will explain each and every step in detail
[14:19] <sayan> Moving ahead then
[14:19] <sayan>  
[14:19] <sayan>  
[14:19] <sayan> *- So, you create a project directory called foobar
[14:19] <ani_> !
[14:20] <sayan> *- After that you initialize git into it, when you do git init it creates a .git directory inside foobar
[14:20] <sayan> *- You can check using ls -l
[14:20] <__anshul> ls -al
[14:21] <sayan> *- This directory contains all the information by Git
[14:21] <__anshul> .git is hidden
[14:21] <tenida> __anshul: Error: "git" is not a valid command.
[14:21] <sayan> oops, yes I missed -a
[14:21] <sayan> the correct command is ls -al
[14:21] <ahole[m]> ls -la
[14:21] <sayan> thanks
[14:22] <vivek_> tenida: install git
[14:22] <tenida> vivek_: Error: "install" is not a valid command.
[14:22] <saikat_> there is some .git. Why can i not see the name?
[14:22] <vivek_> oh
[14:22] <bhavin192> vivek_, tenida is bot
[14:22] <vivek_> i understood
[14:22] <ikshitij> saikat_: that's dotfile
[14:23] <ani_> saikat type ls -al
[14:23] <vipulgupta2048_> ls
[14:23] <saikat_> ani, did ls-al
[14:23] <vipulgupta2048_> with space between ls -al
[14:23] <bhavin192> ls-al command not found
[14:23] <__anshul> the "-a" helps in shows hidden files
[14:24] <vishami3> tenida : you need to install git not type `install git`
[14:24] <tenida> vishami3: Error: ":" is not a valid command.
[14:24] <bhavin192> saikat_, it should be ls -al
[14:24] <saikat_> bhavin192, yes did ls -al in the console, typo here.
[14:24] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: bhavin192: __anshul: can you stop helping saikat_?
[14:24] <__anshul> okay
[14:24] <bhavin192> sayan, ok
[14:25] <vipulgupta2048_> ok
[14:25] <sayan> becase seems like saikat_ did raise hand before asking the question
[14:25] <sayan> s/did/did not/
[14:25] <saikat_> sayan, sorry
[14:25] <bhavin192> right
[14:26] <sayan> *- Next when you do, git add helloworld.txt, it sends the changes to the staging area
[14:26] <sayan> *- and finall git commit -m "Snapshot 1" is where you create the snapsot/commit
[14:26] <Vamsi3296> ls .git
[14:26] <Vamsi3296> im sorry.
[14:27] <bhavin192> Vamsi3296, instant messaging?
[14:27] <sayan> *- You specify the message with -m argument
[14:27] <sayan> bhavin192: yes, apologizing to instant messaging :)
[14:28] <Vamsi3296> No,This iterm is messing with me.
[14:28] <sayan> So, moving ahead
[14:28] <sayan> - vim helloworld.txt # Add "Snapshot 2" to the file
[14:29] <sayan> - git status
[14:29] <sayan> What do you see? Can some one write what does git status show?
[14:30] <__anshul> modified:   file.txt
[14:30] <saikat_> modified:   helloworld.txt
[14:30] <Vamsi3296> changes not staged for commit.
[14:30] <singh123> modified helloworld.txt
[14:30] <__anshul> no changes added to commit
[14:30] <im_mohsin> untracked file sayan
[14:30] <Shruti9520> modified helloworld.txt
[14:30] <asraisingh> modified: helloworld.txt
[14:30] <ani_> modified helloworld.txt
[14:30] <hacker_> no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
[14:30] <santoshShaw> 	modified:   helloworld.txt
[14:31] <anuGupta> nothing added to commit but untracked files present
[14:31] <Vamsi3296> and modified: helloworld.txt.
[14:31] <cran-cg> https://pastebin.com/VvxBYUDM
[14:31] <poojaencoded> modified:  hello.text
[14:31] <asraisingh> changes not staged for comit
[14:31] <sayan> Hmm
[14:31] <sayan> Okay
[14:31] <ikshitij> modified:  helloworld.txt
[14:32] <yurii>  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
[14:32] <cignatious> !
[14:32] <sayan> So, you should be having an out like https://pastebin.com/VvxBYUDM
[14:32] <asraisingh> yes
[14:33] <joyhimanshu> yes
[14:33] <sayan> __anshul: poojaencoded: why are you having other filenames?
[14:33] <sayan> im_mohsin: untracked file?
[14:33] <sayan> next
[14:33] <sayan> next
[14:33] <__anshul> I named it different, no worries
[14:33] <cignatious> changes not staged for commit
[14:33] <vipulgupta2048_> !
[14:34] <cignatious> why is it so?
[14:34] <poojaencoded> i gave my file name hello.txt that's why
[14:34] <sayan> __anshul: It is worries for other people who are learning for the first time
[14:34] <__anshul> okay sayan I'll keep that in mind here onwards
[14:34] <sayan> the difference in output can confuse people
[14:34] <anuGupta> !
[14:35] <sayan> cignatious: You will understand that after the next step that I tell
[14:35] <poojaencoded> i created with vim hello.txt.sorry
[14:35] <sayan> cignatious: so, basically these changes are not yet in the staging area
[14:35] <im_mohsin> sayan, this: nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
[14:35] <anuGupta> It is giving list of untracked files and not like one in pastebin
[14:35] <cignatious> I did it again and now i am getting it as no changes added to commit
[14:36] <sayan> im_mohsin: you probably did not follow all the steps
[14:36] <cignatious> am I doing it right?
[14:36] <sayan> anuGupta: you missed a bunch of steps
[14:36] <im_mohsin> sayan, maybe because internet is not working properly
[14:36] <sayan> im_mohsin: anuGupta: ask someone in PM for the logs
[14:36] <avik_> !
[14:36] <im_mohsin> ok
[14:37] <sayan> cignatious: do you see the output as: https://pastebin.com/VvxBYUDM
[14:37] <sayan> next
[14:37] <Shruti9520> <im_moshin> You can use git add --all
[14:37] <cignatious> no
[14:37] <vipulgupta2048_> Under untracked files it shows this to ".helloworld.txt.swp". What is this file?
[14:37] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: you vim session is probably still open, we explained this in last class
[14:38] <sayan> cignatious: can you past the output in pastebin, on what do you see?
[14:38] <im_mohsin> Shruti9520, thanks :)
[14:38] <cignatious> ok
[14:38] <sayan> anuGupta: Also wait before you ask you question
[14:38] <vishami3> <vipulgupta2048_> You must have not saved it, i think
[14:38] <sayan> anuGupta: wait for your turn
[14:39] <sayan> next
[14:39] <santoshShaw> !
[14:39] <sayan> next
[14:39] <sayan> next
[14:39] <fhackdroid> cignatious, just a word of caution to copy from terminal you have to use ctrl+shift+c
[14:39] <santoshShaw> what does "-m" signifies in the git commit -m "hello" ? <eom>
[14:39] <vipulgupta2048_> sayan, will recheck.
[14:39] <sayan> santoshShaw: check the log, I explained
[14:39] <anuGupta> Ok sayan <EOF>
[14:40] <meamitk> santoshShaw It is commit message
[14:40] <ikshitij> those who are getting "untracked files", you should add a file first using "git add file.ext"
[14:40] <vishami3> <santoshShaw> message that'll explain the changes
[14:40] <cignatious> fhackdroid: i know
[14:41] <santoshShaw> vishami3: meamitk : sayan, thanks
[14:41] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:41] <sayan> - git diff
[14:41] <Shruti9520>  santoshShaw: after writing -m , you give any message to your commit. You can write anything within quotes
[14:42] <sayan> *- With this command you can check the diff, basically the changes you've done but not in stage
[14:42] <sayan> - git add -u
[14:42] <im_mohsin> !
[14:43] <sayan> *- ^^ this moves the changes to the staging area
[14:43] <saikat_> !
[14:43] <sayan> *- git status
[14:43] <soumam007__> ikshitij, though i am not getting so but why are they getting that message?
[14:44] <andodococo> soumam007__: What r u getting ?
[14:44] <sayan> *- Now you would see a different output, as these files are added staging area before the commit
[14:44] <soumam007__> andodococo, "changes not staged for commit"
[14:45] <soumam007__> and no message
[14:45] <soumam007__> language please
[14:45] <bhavin192> andodococo, r? u?
[14:45] <vishami3> !
[14:46] <ani_> !
[14:46] <sayan> next
[14:46] <im_mohsin> sayan, git diff compare changes in the working directory and staging area?
[14:46] <sayan> im_mohsin: yes
[14:46] <sayan> next
[14:46] <saikat_> What is the meaning of the symbols  - and + and a &b in "--- a/helloworld.txt
[14:46] <saikat_> +++ b/helloworld.txt
[14:46] <saikat_> " after doing git diff?
[14:46] <saikat_> <EOM>
[14:47] <__anshul> saikat that means you added some stuff to the said file
[14:47] <sayan> saikat_: - means removed, + means added = this is in code portion
[14:48] <__anshul> !
[14:48] <saikat_> sayan, and the a & B act as bullet points?
[14:48] <sayan> saikat_: and --- a/helloworld.txt +++ b/helloworld.txt  means you are comparing a/helloworld.txt with b/helloworld.txt
[14:48] <sayan> next
[14:48] <vishami3> what does -u means ?
[14:49] <sayan> vishami3: update, moves all the changes from working to staging
[14:49] <sayan> vishami3: and you don't have to add file one by one
[14:49] <sayan> next
[14:49] <sayan> next
[14:49] <vishami3> okay
[14:50] <__anshul> as I answered some queries here, is that acceptable or should I just not interrupt?
[14:50] <cran-cg> !
[14:50] <balaji>  !
[14:50] <santoshShaw> vishami3: The -u tells Git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run git push and Git will know what to do. Link: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/11
[14:50] <sayan> __anshul: it's okay to answer
[14:51] <soumam007__> !
[14:51] <bhavin192> santoshShaw, it's totally different
[14:51] <vishami3> thanks <santoshShaw>
[14:51] <sayan> santoshShaw: no, we are not discussing git push now
[14:51] <sayan> next
[14:51] <sayan> next
[14:51] <cran-cg> sayan: Why aren't we doing git add . ?
[14:52] <sayan> cran-cg: that adds all the files which are untracked also
[14:52] <cran-cg> Plus isn't git push - u different from git add -u <eof>
[14:52] <soumam007__> "@@ -1 +1,3 @@" what does this mean?
[14:52] <sayan> cran-cg: yes, it is totally different
[14:52] <vipulgupta2048_> !
[14:53] <cran-cg> !
[14:53] <sayan> cran-cg: you want to carefully add the untracked files
[14:53] <cran-cg> And the -u flag is different for both the commands right ?
[14:53] <bhavin192> cran-cg, yes
[14:54] <cran-cg> Understood ! Thanks bhavin192 and sayan :))
[14:54] <vishami3> i think every sub-command has there own flags that's why *push -u* is different from *add -u*
[14:54] <sayan> soumam007__: tell you the numbers of lines added & removed and line numbers
[14:54] <sayan> vishami3: yes
[14:54] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:54] <sayan> - git diff --staged
[14:55] <vipulgupta2048_> My question,sayan ?
[14:55] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: yes, you will get your chance but we cannot take all the questions at once
[14:55] <sayan> then probably we never going to end the class
[14:56] <vipulgupta2048_> Ok no issues.
[14:56] <sayan> *- If you do git diff --staged, you see all the changes in the staging area
[14:56] <sayan> *- So it's good to check once before you make the final commit
[14:57] <sayan> - git commit -m "Snapshot 2"
[14:57] <sayan> *- You now create your next commit
[14:57] <sayan> - vim hellomars.txt # Add the text "Snapshot 3"
[14:57] <sayan> - git status
[14:58] <Prerna> nothing to commit
[14:58] <sayan> *- Now, you will see hellomars.txt in the untracked files, because the file is a git directory
[14:58] <ani_> !
[14:58] <sayan> *- But the changes of the file are not getting tracked by git yet
[14:59] <sayan> *- To add the file hellomars.txt for git to track what command show we use?
[14:59] <sayan> Think and answer
[14:59] <jasonbraganza> git add -u
[14:59] <asraisingh> git add
[14:59] <saikat_> git add <file>
[14:59] <cran-cg> git add -u
[14:59] <ikshitij> git add filename
[14:59] <avik_> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <championshutler> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <__anshul> soumam007__git add <filename>
[15:00] <vipulgupta2048_>  git add filename
[15:00] <joyhimanshu> git add  hellomars.txt
[15:00] <anuGupta> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <vishami3> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <__anshul> oops
[15:00] <cran-cg> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <sitlanigaurav[m]> git add -u
[15:00] <singh123> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <realslimshanky> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <ahole[m]> git add -u
[15:00] <santoshShaw> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <sayan> right! it's git add hellomars.txt, can somebody tell me why not git add -u?
[15:00] <realslimshanky> or git add . or git add *
[15:00] <balaji> git add hellomars.txt
[15:01] <__anshul> because "git add -u" is for files who are already staged once
[15:01] <jasonbraganza> sayan because you want be aware of what youâ€™re adding?
[15:01] <realslimshanky> sayan, because it only checks the added file for updates
[15:01] <vishami3> *git add -u* will not look for changes in *untracked8 files
[15:01] <SpEcHiDeR> I think git add -u will add all untracked files.
[15:01] <vipulgupta2048_> Because git add -u will add all files to track in the folder. when dealing with more than one file.
[15:01] <bhavin192> because -u updates the files which are already tracked
[15:01] <avik_> sayan: we are adding, not updating
[15:01] <championshutler> that will add all untracked files i think
[15:02] <Vamsi3296> ls
[15:02] <sayan> Okay, here is why?
[15:02] <joyhimanshu> git add  -u  update all changes
[15:02] <samridhia> git add hellomars.txt
[15:02] <sayan> as the documentation says for `-u` = all tracked files in the entire working tree are updated
[15:02] <sayan> it's does not touch the untracked files
[15:03] <sayan> git add -u moves the diff of the tracked files to staging, and ignore all the untracked files you add
[15:03] <jasonbraganza> sayan understood
[15:03] <im_mohsin> so sayan for already existing file in staging area and now if we add a line to this file then we use git add -u? Correct?
[15:04] <sayan> So, you should explicitly use git add <filename> to tell git track the file from next time and directly move the changes to stage
[15:04] <sitlanigaurav[m]> sayan: got it
[15:04] <__anshul> im_mohsin correct
[15:04] <jasonbraganza> !
[15:04] <SpEcHiDeR> sayan: OK. :thumbs-up
[15:04] <sayan> im_mohsin: yes :)
[15:04] <sayan> next
[15:04] <sayan> next
[15:04] <im_mohsin> __anshul, thank you. I get confused with parameter
[15:05] <vipulgupta2048_> sayan,Doubt resolved
[15:05] <sayan> next
[15:05] <ani_> git add -u not working
[15:06] <sayan> realslimshanky: you should never use dot (.) or asterisk (*) until and unless you know what you are doing
[15:06] <sayan> ani_: context?
[15:06] <sayan> next
[15:06] <realslimshanky> sayan, got it :)
[15:06] <jasonbraganza> git add accepts wild cards? <eom>
[15:06] <sayan> jasonbraganza: yes
[15:06] <jasonbraganza> Thank you
[15:06] <vipulgupta2048_> !
[15:06] <sayan> next
[15:07] <vipulgupta2048_> Wild cards ? or should i just google that
[15:07] <__anshul> ani_ error message?
[15:07] <sayan> Yeah google :)
[15:07] <sayan> you probably will find a wiki page for it
[15:07] <sayan> - git add hellomars.txt
[15:07] <ani_> sorry it work
[15:07] <sayan> *- So add the hellomars.txt file
[15:07] <sayan> - git commit -m "Snapshot 3"
[15:08] <sayan> *- And then we commit
[15:08] <ani_> !
[15:08] <sayan> next
[15:08] <sayan> Any questions till here?
[15:09] <realslimshanky> No
[15:09] <Vamsi3296> nope.
[15:09] <im_mohsin> No
[15:09] <avik_> no
[15:09] <saikat_> !
[15:09] <ani_> it was producing error nothing to commit, working directory clean
[15:09] <sitlanigaurav[m]> no
[15:09] <vipulgupta2048_> Wild card is used for adding more than one files for git add
[15:09] <balaji> !
[15:10] <realslimshanky> vipulgupta2048_, yeah, like dot  ( . ) and asterisk ( * )
[15:10] <sayan> ani_: did you create the hellomars.txt file?
[15:10] <cran-cg> vipulgupta2048_: not exactly
[15:10] <meamitk> ani_ it is not an error
[15:10] <ani_> no
[15:10] <ani_> ok thanks
[15:10] <vipulgupta2048_> realslimshanky, will look that up, thanks.
[15:10] <sayan> realslimshanky: dot is not a wildcard
[15:10] <vipulgupta2048_> cran-cg, then ?
[15:11] <ashwanig> !
[15:11] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/wildcard.htm
[15:11] <soumam007__> !
[15:11] <sayan> next
[15:11] <saikat_> What is this create mode number in "create mode 100644 hellomars.txt"?
[15:11] <sayan> saikat_: ah! nice question
[15:12] <sayan> There is actually a good answer in SO
[15:12] <realslimshanky> !
[15:12] <sayan> next
[15:12] <vishami3> <saikat_> i think it is similar to taking a snapshot for that commit file
[15:12] <balaji> Can we able edit the commit messeges?
[15:12] <ashwanig> Got the answer<eom>
[15:12] <sayan> saikat_: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/737673/how-to-read-the-mode-field-of-git-ls-trees-output/8347325#8347325
[15:12] <sayan> balaji: yes, you can. git commit --amend -m "New message"
[15:12] <sayan> next
[15:13] <sayan> next
[15:13] <soumam007__> why we will add (.) ?Is it that . .. you are talking about that are hidden and present in all directories?
[15:13] <sayan> soumam007__: no, this is completely different thing
[15:13] <balaji> sayan,  But how can we specify which commit messege we have to edit ?
[15:14] <soumam007__> ok please elaborate if possible
[15:14] <sayan> balaji: you cannot do that by specifying like a commit id
[15:14] <poojaencoded> !
[15:14] <sayan> balaji: but there is a way which is out of scope of this class
[15:15] <sayan> soumam007__: yes, when you do git add . it moves all the files from untracked & tracked to stage
[15:15] <sayan> next
[15:15] <balaji> sayan, Okay we will discuss after the class
[15:15] <sayan> next
[15:15] <realslimshanky> sayan, it's for adding hidden files ( which begin with . ) also along with others right? What is it called?
[15:15] <poojaencoded> sayan,not got "create mode 100644 hellomars.txt"?
[15:15] <soumam007__> ok and what for git add * ?
[15:15] <sayan> soumam007__: same
[15:15] <soumam007__> ok :)
[15:16] <poojaencoded> what is this and why is this?<eof>
[15:16] <sayan> poojaencoded: it's okay, if you don't get it now
[15:16] <realslimshanky> soumam007_, adding all the files except hidden ( starting with . ) files.
[15:16] <poojaencoded> okay
[15:16] <__anshul> poojaencoded you would have got this when you committed
[15:17] <cran-cg> soumam007__: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16969768/what-does-git-add-git-add-single-dot-command-do . Files present in currentdirectory and subdirectory
[15:17] <poojaencoded> _anshul:thanks
[15:17] <soumam007__> realslimshanky, cran-cg i will look into it thanks :)
[15:17] <sayan> soumam007__: right git add * does not add the hidden files
[15:17] <sayan> where as git add . does
[15:18] <soumam007__> ok there is the difference
[15:18] <sayan> but at the end of the day you should not use both
[15:18] <sayan> realslimshanky: I don't know if it is called anything
[15:18] <sayan> next
[15:18] <soumam007__> sayan, so that we can distinguish right?
[15:19] <realslimshanky> sayan, okay.
[15:19] <saikat_> !
[15:19] <sayan> soumam007__: no, you will mess up if you use that
[15:19] <sayan> soumam007__: you will end up changes that you don't want to add
[15:19] <soumam007__> oh
[15:19] <sayan> next
[15:19] <saikat_> sayan, SO says "1000000110110100 (100664): Regular non-executable group-writeable file."    Why is it not executable? I am executing it in git.
[15:20] <__anshul> soumam007__ then later you have to sit down and unstage unnecessary files
[15:20] <__anshul> for example the local files an IDE generates which are not needed in project repo
[15:20] <rkased> roll call: Razy Kased
[15:21] <sayan> saikat_: you are not executing it with Git
[15:21] <sayan> rkased: ? Why the roll call out of sudden?
[15:21] <soumam007__> __anshul, yeah thats an issue
[15:21] <rkased> I've been having login issues sorry
[15:21] <saikat_> sayan, ohh, i am just commiting a change, right?
[15:22] <sayan> saikat_: I will discuss this after class
[15:22] <__anshul> soumam007__, I am guessing sayan will you later about ignoring
[15:22] <saikat_> sayan, ok, thanks
[15:22] <Cyber_freak> Missed the class. Internet issues :-(
[15:22] <sayan> I am ending the class here.
[15:22] <im_mohsin> ok sayan :)
[15:22] <sayan> I would like to tell a few things
[15:23] <soumam007__> __anshul, didnot get you please rephrase if possible
[15:23] <soumam007__> :)
[15:23] <sayan> You cannot become a pro in the very first day
[15:23] <sayan> So, learn to ignore things
[15:23] <__anshul> in DMs may be <soumam007__> ;)
[15:23] <rkased> okay
[15:23] <vishami3> okay sayan
[15:23] <sayan> You don't need to learn each an everything on the very first day
[15:24] <sayan> Stick to the basics, you can build on top of basics
[15:24] <rkased> sayan, I always feel if I don't I need doing enough. However, your advice helps put things into perspective
[15:24] <Farhaan[m]> soumam007 anshul depends on your gitignore which sayan will tell you later
[15:25] <__anshul> <Farhaan[m]> , correct
[15:25] <sayan> and people those who know stuff, take care in mind there are people who don't know stuff and are learning
[15:25] <sayan> So, stop throwing random words, it's becomes difficult for those who are just trying to follow and learn
[15:26] <Farhaan[m]> sayan agreed
[15:27] <sayan> I did not know a lot of things like +++ a/... --- b/, then 100664, until I had been using git for 2-3 years
[15:27] <poojaencoded> sayan,you are right it is difficult for us
[15:27] <anuGupta> relatable ;)
[15:27] <sayan> And those you are new, try to be often on IRC and ask question. Just doing join in for the class
[15:27] <sayan> And devote more time than just reading logs
[15:28] <sayan> ask for books from people
[15:28] <im_mohsin> sayan, 100% true. I faced issues initially where i wanted to know every stuff the point i start but its a very bad learning habit
[15:29] <sayan> That's all what I want to say, from next time in class I would just tell you too stop if things would be tough for other people
[15:29] <sayan> and I want people to follow that
[15:29] <jasonbraganza> understood sayan
[15:29] <sayan> You can ask those questoins after the class
[15:29] <realslimshanky> sayan, nice :)
[15:29] <vishami3> sure
[15:29] <sayan> Telling this because things are going to be difficult in next class, so I want cooperation from all of you
