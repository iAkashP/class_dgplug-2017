[13:58] <kushal> akshayg96, also you never mentioned any license
[13:58] <sayan> People can you please answer? I cannot really sit idle here staring at the screen
[13:58] <avik> I am still working on in! :(
[13:59] <akshayg96> kushal, I forgot that :(
[13:59] <sayan> avik: you can put the github link atleast?
[13:59] <samridhia> i did no new work on GitHub in last two days :-(
[13:59] <avik> I am writing on the notebook
[13:59] <_RicharD_> I did nothing. And got to work on this today. :/
[14:00] <kushal> And others?
[14:00] <sayan> avik: writing in a notebook?
[14:00] <balaji> Shall I update it tomorrow ?
[14:00] <sayan> balaji: why not today?
[14:01] <avik> https://notebooks.azure.com/technotron/libraries/dgplug/html/number_converter.ipynb
[14:01] <cignatious> i came back after almost 3 weeks and i am still catching up, sorry
[14:01] <balaji> sayan,  I am not done yet
[14:02] <ashwanig> Sorry, can I do it after the class? I have not started it.
[14:02] <kushal> avik, that notebook is from 30minutes of work.
[14:02] <anuGupta> I missed your question sayan
[14:02] <NikitaK3> I missed last few sessions, catching up with the logs.
[14:03] <avik> yeah, that took me 1 hour yesterday
[14:03] <sayan> NikitaK3: if I remember correctly, you attended last class
[14:03] <avik> and then a few more hours to get the logics
[14:03] <ikshitij> sayan: I had classes and lab work ! I will update next day for sure.
[14:03] <avik> of conversion
[14:03] <santoshShaw> Roll Call: Santosh Kumar Shaw
[14:04] <avik> kushal, Its all done, I will finish it by today!
[14:04] <sayan> Seriously speaking, we all have jobs, classes, lab work or any other work you have
[14:05] <NikitaK3> sayan, yes but I was unable to attend the entire last session. And also missed few sessions before the last one. I will surely finish all the logs till tomorrow.
[14:05] <sayan> samridhia: I know your work because I am reading your blog regularly
[14:06] <samridhia> sayan, ok
[14:06] <sayan> samridhia: but you have to push your code
[14:07] <mdbk> I'm new to python language, still getting around with the basics for more understanding
[14:07] <sayan> mdbk: that means you need to come here and ask more questions
[14:08] <kushal> Point is very simple: If you don't work, we will not care.
[14:08] <samridhia> sayan, I am not yet so well versed with GitHub, so investing my most of the time experimenting GitHub for now.
[14:08] <kushal> If we our lives, and we will be busy helping out people who really need help.
[14:08] <mdbk> sayan: okay
[14:08] <Guest11596> i missed some git sessions. was reading them yesterday.
[14:09] <kushal> You will keep looking at them because they will become better, they will work better projects, and work on good jobs (in future, eventually) etc etc.
[14:09] <sayan> Guest11596: I already told you to change your nick once
[14:09] <bhavin192> Guest11596, may we know, who are you? :(
[14:09] <kushal> No one is paying us to help you.
[14:09] <Guest11596> atul kumar
[14:09] <championshuttler> Shivam Singhal
[14:09] <kushal> bhavin192, No we can not (at least that is what he thinks).
[14:10] <kushal> championshuttler, What exactly are you smoking during the class?
[14:10] <kushal> Please do it afterwards.
[14:10] <kushal> You all are online, but doing nothing.
[14:10] <kushal> Only 3 people submitted links to their github repos.
[14:11] <kushal> It is okay if you are slow, and doing something taught in the old sessions, but there must be a blog post showing that.
[14:11] <sayan> jasonbraganza came online to ask how was his code written
[14:11] <ikshitij> kushal sayan I am doing now, writing a simple Dice game
[14:11] <kushal> ikshitij, What did you do over the weekend?
[14:12] <sayan> ikshitij: or rather last 2 days?
[14:12] <sayan> If you see jasonbraganza did 33 commits: https://github.com/jasonbraganza/mjbneue/commits/master
[14:12] <jasonbraganza> most of which are crap commits :P
[14:13] <sayan> jasonbraganza: yes, but they are commits. I would give you suggestions on what to change
[14:13] <kushal> jasonbraganza, Still better than most of these people here.
[14:13] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, I was happy to see your script running :)
[14:13] <sayan> jasonbraganza: that's the way to do, write small changes
[14:13] <kushal> There is blue pill for you all.
[14:13] <kushal> We can not make you learn everything in one hour.
[14:14] <sayan> I need proper reasons for me to take to class today?
[14:14] <jasonbraganza> sayan - like God told Abraham, I would do it for 5 good people? :P
[14:15] <kushal> jasonbraganza, we don't even have those 5
[14:15] <sayan> jasonbraganza: and people would lag and lag more
[14:16] <sayan> jasonbraganza: and then they won't understand stuffs
[14:16] <jasonbraganza> yikes
[14:17] <sayan> but they won't even ask questions
[14:17] <sayan> so, I am canceling the class for the day but people need to stay online and complete the task
[14:18] <sayan> and this is the last warning for all of you guys, all the tasks given in the class are IMPORTANT
[14:18] <sayan> and needs to be completed within the given time
[14:18] <sayan> Any questions
[14:20] <sayan> santoshShaw: what link did you post?
[14:20] <santoshShaw> I have missed some classes.So can I submit the assignments now?
[14:21] <sayan> santoshShaw: then why did you post an old repo?
[14:21] <santoshShaw> sayan sorry for the post
[14:22] <sayan> Okay, so those people who missed the class they need to post their links by tomorrow
[14:23] <santoshShaw> sayan : Thanks
[14:23] <sayan> ^^ I will be running the script that checks the attendence of the students through the logs
[14:23] <sayan> which will give who missed the classes
[14:24] <sayan> and those who did not I want in next 2-3 hours
[14:24] <sayan> if you have questions ask
[14:25] <jasonbraganza> speaking of kushal & sayan not being paid, itâ€™s easy to underestimate the value of what they are teaching us.
[14:26] <asraisingh> sayan, I didn't attended complete previous session can I submit it by tomorrow?
[14:26] <asraisingh> I'm going through last session log.
[14:26] <jasonbraganza> trust me, a single online class membership is easily 2000 bucks a month. personal mentorship is 10 times that
[14:27] <jasonbraganza> a full semester like kushal and sayan teach, can easily run into lacs!
[14:27] <jasonbraganza> not counting the guests!
[14:27] <jasonbraganza> There is gold to be had here! for free! if only you invest the time!
[14:27] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, yes, you are right!
[14:27] <sayan> asraisingh: that would take 30 mins at max
[14:27] <jasonbraganza> </endrant>
[14:27] <kushal> jasonbraganza, that would be 4-5lakhs in total easily.
[14:28] <asraisingh> sayan, ok
