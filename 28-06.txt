[13:35] <rkased_> It was verified that it was correct
[13:35] <kushal> rkased_, check the url I just now gave.
[13:35] <jasonbraganza> kushal: probably some wrong circumstances with rkased_ . we validated his feed. it was fine

[13:39] <kushal> If you do not understand what is a feed, please ask now.
[13:39] <kushal> Asking is okay.
[13:39] <Raut> kushal : OK
[13:40] <kushal> Raut, look at the other examples from the https://github.com/dgplug/studentsplanet/blob/master/planet.ini#L57
[13:40] <kushal> Raut, and then fix the URL
[13:40] <Raut> kushal : Yes.
[13:40] <devesh_V> !
[13:40] <kushal> next
[13:40] <ashwanig> I have been practicing on gtypist. Should I touch type everytime I type? Because when I have to type faster I can't touch type. Also I am having a tendency to forget which key is home position for which finger. So I am making errors everytime I start again after a break.<eof>
[13:41] <kushal> ashwanig, you will get it with time.
[13:41] <kushal> ashwanig, no worries, just keep doing touch typing whenever you are using computers.
[13:41] <niranjana> kushal , sorry, have modified my entry <eof>
[13:41] <kushal> next
[13:41] <devesh_V> Where can I correct my URL
[13:42] <kushal> devesh_V, the same place where you wrote it?
[13:42] <devesh_V> Yes
[13:42] <kushal> devesh_V, correct it there.
[13:42] <devesh_V> Okay:)
[13:42] <kushal> cran-cg, / at the end
[13:42] <kushal> same for devesh_V
[13:42] <kushal> cran-cg, yup
[13:43] <cran-cg> kushal: sorry
[13:43] <kushal> cran-cg, no problem, now fixed
[13:43] <kushal> Anyway, coming back.
[13:43] <cran-cg> Thanks :)
[13:43] <kushal> Before we do anything new.
[13:43] <kushal> We started this training, and just into things.
[13:44] <kushal> But, we are yet to discuss why.
[13:44] <kushal> Why do we care?
[13:44] <kushal> Why should one learn these things?
[13:44] <kushal> What is upstream?
[13:44] <kushal> Why contribution matters?
[13:44] <Raut> !
[13:44] <kushal> We are going to have a session on these points, we will learn a bit about the history, and also why are we doing this.
[13:45] <kushal> next
[13:45] <asraisingh> ashwanig, there is some physical symbols on the keys J and F which helps to decide you j and k during touch typing
[13:45] <Raut> kushal:Actually, I corrected it, can you please check if it is right now?
[13:45] <kushal> Raut, yup, it is correct.
[13:45] <Raut> kushal : Thanks.

[13:49] <kushal> sudo dnf install or sudo apt-get install
[13:49] <kushal> The name is discount
[13:50] <kushal> Markdown is plain text format which can be converted into HTML in an easy way.
[13:50] <kushal> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown is the wiki page.
[13:51] <ani> ME
[13:51] <kushal> Now, before reading the wikipedia page, read this blog post: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001189

[13:56] <soumam007> kushal,  i didnot understand its the error in the terminal written
[13:56] <kushal> https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/ this is a simple tutorial of Markdown format.

[14:00] <kushal> next
[14:01] <sitlanigaurav[m]> Can we use it to create web pages after converting to HTML ?<eom>
[14:01] <kushal> sitlanigaurav[m], HTML files are web pages.

[14:28] <samridhia> kushal: what is pastebin!
[14:28] <kushal> samridhia, :(
[14:28] <messifc> samridhia: plz stop :(
[14:28] <vipulgupta2048> Google pastebin
[14:28] <kushal> messifc, and you also stop typing plz.
[14:28] <bhavin192> samridhia, wow!, thanks you for flooding :(
[14:28] <ihp_> samridhia, Just open the link Kushal has sent.
[14:28] <kushal> samridhia, I just now gave you the link  paste.fedoraproject.org
[14:29] <samridhia> yes okay
[14:29] <kushal> samridhia, Open that, and then paste, and give us the URL
[14:29] <bhavin192> kvy_, which distro?
[14:29] <kushal> samridhia, In your case it already says that there is a discount-mkd2html command
[14:29] <skat_sd> ikshitij, mkd2html command not found
[14:29] <kushal> use that.
[14:29] <kushal> skat_sd, Which distribution?
[14:29] <kvy_> bhavin192 fedora 25
[14:29] <ikshitij> skat_sd: then you have to install discount packages :)
[14:30] <kushal> kvy_, discount-mkd2html is the command
[14:30] <skat_sd> kushal, got it, did not type discount before mkd2html
[14:30] <kushal> skat_sd, nope, if you are in fedora then that is the right command, for debian/ubuntu, it is different
[14:30] <kvy_> kushal ok i will try this too
[14:31] <kushal> next
[14:31] <kushal> next
[14:31] <kushal> next
[14:31] <im_mohsin> kushal, i got the gist of Markdown. Since i didint attend from beginning can i know what do we have to do now?
[14:31] <skat_sd> kushal, what is the complete command?
[14:31] <neer> I am using ubuntu 16.04, discount aint working but If i do mardown filename.md that works
[14:31] <soumam007> skat_sd, its varying from system to system i wrote discount it wasnt working but when i used only mkd2html helo.md it worked
[14:31] <kushal> im_mohsin, just read the channel
[14:31] <ahole[m]> Which would be the best possible text editor/IDE with auto complete and error highlighting for markdown? Because if we are writing books in markdown we might need something to help us writing way too much of markdown code. <eom>
[14:31] <kushal> neer, Okay
[14:31] <skat_sd> ikshitij, how do i see the converted file?
[14:31] <neer> markdown filename.md>filename.html<eof>
[14:32] <im_mohsin> For that i have to wait for log to uploaded
[14:32] <kushal> ahole[m], That means you want a good editor, as markdown is plain text, any editor can do. Which one you prefer?
[14:32] <rkased> !
[14:32] <kushal> ahole[m], I use vim, code, or pycharm, or focuswriter
[14:32] <kushal> Based on what I am writing.
[14:32] <kushal> next
[14:33] <jasonbraganza> ahole[m] - the syntax is pretty compact. you can easily hold it in your head - https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
[14:33] <kushal> next
[14:34] <im_mohsin> !
[14:34] <kushal> next
[14:34] <ikshitij> skat_sd: use *ls* command to see file in that directory ! it should be like this --> hello.md hello.html .
[14:34] <im_mohsin> kushal, Do i need to download any editor?
[14:35] <kushal> im_mohsin, for?
[14:35] <im_mohsin> MarkDown
[14:35] <asraisingh> im_mohsin, you  can use vim.
[14:35] <kushal> im_mohsin, We use vim here (mostly).
[14:36] <rkased> While reading more on Markdown, it is mentioned there is no clearly defined standard, which standard/version are we working on?
[14:36] <skat_sd> ikshitij, mkd2html command not working
[14:36] <jasonbraganza> The John Gruber / Aaron Schwartz original
[14:36] <kushal> rkased, depends on the tooling
[14:36] <rkased> Okay, thank you
[14:37] <rkased> okay, thank you
[14:37] <kushal> rkased, for now we are using what jasonbraganza said.
[14:37] <maxking> Although, there are some markdown editors that show you in realtime how the HTML would look like. Might be helpful sometimes.
[14:37] <im_mohsin> kushal, i have a doubt after reading wiki page. Markdown is mostly converted to HTML for building website?
[14:37] <kushal> im_mohsin, yes
[14:37] <soumam007> !
[14:38] <kushal> im_mohsin, or to write a book
[14:38] <kushal> next
[14:38] <soumam007> can we do everything in md what we can do in html?
[14:38] <im_mohsin> Why is it? I understand it is plaintext but that is a overload right?
[14:38] <kushal> soumam007, nope, you can still write complex HTML by hand.
[14:39] <ikshitij> skat_sd: " kushal> kvy_, discount-mkd2html is the command"
[14:39] <maxking> soumam007: no! There is a lot of things you cannot do, like adding classes to elements and stuff. But that is because mardkown is meant only to write.
[14:39] <skat_sd> ikshitij, solved, i was putting an extra space before the -
[14:39] <kushal> im_mohsin, What is an overload?
[14:39] <skat_sd> ikshitij, yes, used that command now, works, thanks
[14:40] <im_mohsin> kushal, Extra work
[14:40] <rkased> !
[14:40] <kushal> im_mohsin, understood, but which one?
[14:40] <kushal> im_mohsin, let me show you an example.
[14:40] <im_mohsin> Ok
[14:41] <kushal> im_mohsin, Look at this blog post
[14:41] <kushal> im_mohsin, view source
[14:41] <soumam007> kushal, maxking , ok so thats for casual purpose of writing docs
[14:41] <kushal> im_mohsin, and then tell me typing that or just typing https://kushaldas.in/posts/updates-on-my-python-community-work-16-17.md is easier?
[14:42] <kushal> soumam007, Not casual, for serious work too
[14:42] <maxking> soumam007: casual is not the term I would use, but essentially markdown is for "content" more than "styles"
[14:42] <soumam007> ok
[14:42] <maxking> Although, you can pretty easily style markdown and there are some really good looking blogs/websites based on markdown
[14:42] <kushal> im_mohsin, tell us?
[14:43] <soumam007> maxking, name some
[14:43] <im_mohsin> kushal, Typing that mean the blog where you have used markdown?
[14:43] <jasonbraganza> soumam007: https://janusworx.com :P
[14:43] <kushal> im_mohsin, typing the html by hand, or the markdown I actually wrote?
[14:43] <kushal> You said overload, but did not tell us which one is the overload.
[14:43] <im_mohsin> Obviously, markdown seem simpler
[14:43] <maxking> jasonbraganza: That looks really nice!
[14:44] <pr97> !
[14:44] <maxking> soumam007: Nothing on top of my head
[14:44] <kushal> soumam007, Ghost
[14:44] <kushal> soumam007, Hugo
[14:44] <kushal> soumam007, shonku
[14:44] <kushal> next
[14:44] <soumam007> seems there are many
[14:45] <kushal> soumam007, yes, many.
[14:45] <kushal> soumam007, wordpress.
[14:45] <rkased> Is there a way to check my place in queue within the dgplug questions line?
[14:45] <kushal> rkased, Nope, but that can be a good idea to implement
[14:45] <kushal> rkased, we will add that.
[14:45] <kushal> next
[14:45] <im_mohsin> kushal, So markdown is only for light weight task like writing blogs and things alike?
[14:45] <pr97> kushal, I installed discount, but here is the error https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/2uIGMCtqyzHO5-FPktGxGQ and I am using ubuntu 14.04
[14:45] <rkased> I would be interested on how you set  that up if possible. Thank you
[14:46] <kushal> im_mohsin, writing blog or books, or documents or emails are very heavy weight work.
[14:46] <im_mohsin> Oh Yeah :)
[14:46] <kushal> pr97, the command mkd2html
[14:46] <soumam007> rkased, got a practical idea of queue of data structures today :)
[14:46] <kushal> rkased, You will have to write some go code.
[14:47] <kushal> next
[14:47] <rkased> I'm down for that.
[14:47] <sayan> rkased: down for what?
[14:47] <pr97> kushal, after mkd2html command?
[14:47] <kushal> pr97, I will not tell you.
[14:47] <rkased> Writing go code.
[14:47] <rkased> :)
[14:47] <pr97> okay, thanks kushal
[14:47] <kushal> pr97, After 1 hour you are asking this.
[14:48] <although> https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining see this @pr97
[14:48] <ikshitij> kushal: :)
[14:48] <ahole[m]> This won't work now.
[14:49] <pr97> okay thanks although
[14:49] <im_mohsin> !
[14:50] <sayan> next
[14:50] <kushal> next
[14:50] <im_mohsin> kushal, what is mkd2html and discount? i'm a bit curious. can't wait for the log to come out :)
[14:50] <bhavin192> im_mohsin, just search about it.
[14:50] <kushal> im_mohsin, They are tools to make us (the trainers) frustrated.
[14:51] <CuriousLearner> kushal: +1
[14:52] <im_mohsin> hahaha :D
[14:52] <kushal> Our next session will be on Friday.
[14:52] <soumam007> im_mohsin discount is the parser to convert and mkd2html is the command
[14:52] <im_mohsin> soumam007, convert markdown to html?
[14:52] <soumam007> yes :)
[14:52] <although> yes mohisin :)
[14:53] <soumam007> CuriousLearner, what is +1? i often see it
[14:53] <vipulgupta2048> !
[14:53] <Raut> kushal : Ok
[14:53] <im_mohsin> soumam007, although thanks :)
[14:53] <kushal> next
[14:53] <cran-cg> CuriousLearner: Its a thumbs up
[14:53] <vipulgupta2048> So now on the idea would be to write your content using markdown and integrating it with the HTML code to boost productivity, right ?
[14:53] <soumam007> cran-cg, oh niceway
[14:54] <kushal> Tonight first learn about markdown, and then write a blog post explaining it.
[14:54] <soumam007> +1
[14:54] <soumam007> to you
[14:54] <asraisingh> kushal, +1
[14:54] <skat_sd> soumam007, see, you learn fast!
