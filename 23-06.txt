[13:45] <cran-cg> !
[13:45] <santoshShaw> Can you share your .vimrc file? It will help us <EOF>
[13:45] <HoloIRCUser1> ok kushal

[13:46] <skat_sd> Hi, can anyone help me:In vim, When I do :/ something to search and at another time, :/ *something* , both cases are not showing same search results. What is the difference? I did a google search anf it says the 2nd case does a search inside the lines. But, then what does the 1st case do?
[13:46] <sayan> here is mine: couple of plugins I use: https://da.gd/9iIa
[13:47] <sayan> skat_sd: when you search you just press /<search term>
[13:47] <skat_sd> sayan, not giving all results
[13:48] <kushal> skat_sd, show us an example.
[13:48] <sayan> skat_sd: so you have the space in there?
[13:48] <kushal> next
[13:48] <anuGupta> When I am searching for words it's highlited,even when I am reopening it it's still highlighted.How to get rid of this?<EOF>
[13:48] <skat_sd> sayan, yes.
[13:48] <kushal> anuGupta, I just search for a random text :p
[13:48] <vivek_> anuGupta: :nohl
[13:48] <skat_sd> kushal,  let me pastebin something for you.
[13:49] <sayan> anuGupta: :nohlsearch
[13:49] <kushal> okay.
[13:49] <kushal> sayan, Thanks.
[13:49] <kushal> I learned something :)
[13:49] <anuGupta> Oh thanks
[13:49] <sayan> skat_sd: you when you use *, it works as wildcard
[13:49] <kushal> next
[13:49] <imranjeetsingh_> there seems to be alot of command so only practice will help or there is some way to keep in mind?<eof>
[13:49] <sayan> skat_sd: so it matches anything before it
[13:49] <sayan> skat_sd: if I understood your question correctly
[13:49] <kushal> imranjeetsingh_, Yes, and practice means you will have to use the tools regularly.
[13:49] <kushal> For vim, you have to start using it for everything.
[13:50] <kushal> Write everything in vim only.
[13:50] <skat_sd> sayan, matches anything before it means?
[13:50] <sayan> imranjeetsingh_: it all boils down to preferences, I will take a hands-on on how I use vim
[13:50] <imranjeetsingh_> ok
[13:50] <kushal> imranjeetsingh_, read http://norvig.com/21-days.html :)
[13:50] <kushal> next
[13:50] <sayan> skat_sd: do you know about wild-cards?
[13:51] <skat_sd> sayan, I saw a video by Eli the computer Guy on vim editor, there he said abt wild card
[13:51] <kushal> skarpy, abt?
[13:51] <kushal> oops
[13:51] <kushal> skat_sd, abt?
[13:51] <skat_sd> Though couldn't understand its difference with normal search
[13:51] <kushal> abta is All Bengal Teachers Association
[13:52] <kushal> skat_sd, Missing a letter?
[13:52] <kushal> next
[13:52] <ahole[m]> I was using fedora 25 on my system, yesterday I observed a strange thing that when I saw the first line of my man page of vi editor. It said "vi enhanced". So is it that all latest releases of all distros have vim per installed or vi is used as an alias in these newer releases ? Is vi deprecated or something?
[13:52] <kushal> ahole[m], in Fedora vi is an alias to vim
[13:52] <kushal> ahole[m], do this
[13:53] <kushal> $ which vi
[13:54] <kushal> next
[13:54] <rkased> YOu guys should try the vimtutor if you haven't it's helpful IMO.
[13:54] <kushal> How are people doing with touch typing?
[13:54] <rkased> Excellent
[13:55] <RIcharD_> Hard time :(
[13:55] <apoorv28goel> making progress
[13:55] <imranjeetsingh_> will take some time.
[13:55] <abhinavshirur> kushal: less struggle than before :P
[13:55] <niranjana> Moving/Crawling
[13:55] <harshcrop> not get much time on that because of gsoc
[13:55] <anuGupta> Practicing:)
[13:55] <singh123_> Doing on daily basis
[13:55] <deepika> Progress :)
[13:55] <priyansh> Enjoying :p
[13:55] <sayan> Good :)
[13:55] <pr97> doing daily
[13:55] <shivamA1> hard but enjoying
[13:55] <apoorv28goel> its difficult to press REturn key with oinky finger
[13:55] <ashwanig> kushal, Typing speed slowed down very much. But learning it.
[13:56] <jasonbraganza> kushal I hate gtypist now. my fingers hurt
[13:56] <im_mohsin> kushal, Touch Typing is taking tome for me. slow
[13:56] <wrik003> hey, sorry i'm late. had work at college.
[13:56] <akshayg96[m]> Practicing well
[13:56] <wrik003> Roll call: Wrik Bhadra
[13:56] <cran-cg>  I entered this on the console ``vi +12 python_gcd.py``. I was on the first character of the 12th line as it had to be. Then I typed J , went to the next line ( the 12th line was the for loop declaration and 13th was the line where I did some manipulation on a variable), the cursor pointed at a blank space, (space character I suppose) but then when I used + on the 12th line my cursor was on the alphabetic character. Why was it so ?
[13:56] <bhavin192> kushal, little struggle with Shift
[13:56] <jasonbraganza> kushal, but slow progress :)
[13:56] <cran-cg> <eof>
[13:56] <HoloIRCUser1> practicing daily! but still slow improvement
[13:56] <skarpy> kushal: some progress obviously.
[13:56] <cran-cg> And sorry for taking up time
[13:56] <neer> making progress
[13:56] <iKshitij> Positive :)
[13:56] <ahole[m]> Sometimes it get's a bit irritating when you just miss it by a character.
[13:56] <sitlanigaurav[m]> kushal: sometimes the words per minute are more sometimes less.<eom>
[13:56] <sayan> cran-cg: you were typing all this time?
[13:57] <cran-cg> Yes. I was framing the question
[13:57] <Skhk634> great.
[13:57] <kushal> Suggestion: do not worry about speed now.
[13:58] <iKshitij> It's easy to type common English word like 'then', 'when', 'there' :)
[13:58] <kushal> Just make sure that you can type without any errors, speed will come anyway.
[13:58] <iKshitij> kushal: I agree !
[13:58] <sayan> cran-cg: I am not very clear with your question, sounds like magic
[13:59] <sayan> cran-cg: I did not understand anything after "the cursor point at a blank space"
[13:59] <wrik003> !
[13:59] <sitlanigaurav[m]> kushal: its a work in progress.<eom>
[13:59] <avik> kushal, as to that I can't solve my typos! what to do?
[13:59] <kushal> avik, Means?
[13:59] <avik> a lot of errors!
[13:59] <vivek_> slow down
[14:00] <ahole[m]> !
[14:00] <deepika> !
[14:00] <sayan> avik: what errors? are you doing a lot of typing mistakes?
[14:00] <kushal> avik, work on that first, reduce the number of errors by typing slow.
[14:00] <avik> sayup
[14:00] <sayan> avik: if you are doing typing mistakes, then as vivek_ told slow down
[14:00] <kushal> next
[14:00] <avik> sayan, yup
[14:00] <wrik003> Did we do anything related to vim, the advanced part? (i missed out on the first 28 minutes) <eof>
[14:00] <iKshitij> avik: kushal told already, try to focus on less typing error. Type slow but correct
[14:00] <sayan> it will take time, I have the same issue, my brain is faster than my fingers
[14:01] <abhinavshirur> wrik003, you missed the link to sayan's configuration file
[14:01] <abhinavshirur> :P
[14:01] <avik> sayan, something like that happens
[14:01] <cran-cg> sayan: 12 th line starts with f and 13th Line starts with G. So when I press J on the 12th line my cursor is on the 13th line but pointing to a space, while when I use + on the 12th line my cursor points to G on the 13th line
[14:02] <wrik003> abhinavshirur, hah, i'll get on that later! did i miss anything important? rather, what were we discussing? <eof>
[14:02] <abhinavshirur> nothing else wrik003
[14:02] <skat_sd> !
[14:02] <sayan> cran-cg: I still trying to understand, ask in after the class
[14:02] <wrik003> abhinavshirur, ok, thanks!
[14:02] <sayan> cran-cg: I will you give some tools to replicate
[14:02] <kushal> next
[14:02] <sayan> next
[14:03] <ahole[m]> Continuing my question.
[14:03] <deepika>  can we automate to load the previous vim sessions that we were working on ?<EOF>
[14:03] <ahole[m]> So vi is not there at all in the latest releases? Or is there any means by which you can install it?
[14:03] <ahole[m]> <eom>
[14:03] <cran-cg> Ok sayan thanks again :))
[14:03] <sayan> deepika: what do you mean by vim sessions?
[14:03] <Skhk634> kushal,sayan: Sorry I have to leave in the middle of class as i am travelling and internet is too slow.
[14:03] <kushal> ahole[m], I never tried.
[14:03] <sayan> deepika: do you mean start from the same place where you left last time?
[14:04] <ahole[m]> kushal: okay I'll do some googling!
[14:04] <vishami3> !
[14:04] <deepika> Yeah
[14:04] <sayan> deepika: yes, you can do that
[14:04] <SpEcHiDeR> Skhk634: switch to Matrix, and never loose an IRC conversation
[14:04] <deepika> Sayan^^
[14:04] <sayan> deepika: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/774560/in-vim-how-do-i-get-a-file-to-open-at-the-same-line-number-i-closed-it-at-last
[14:04] <im_mohsin> !
[14:04] <sayan> deepika: you need to add it to the vimrc file
[14:04] <sayan> next
[14:04] <skat_sd> kushal, not missing any letter. I cant pastebin because I have to press enter after writing the command for searching in vim, but here is the thing: My document has a word  'Some' to the extreme left of 2nd line. when i do" :/ Some," it says pattern not found, when i do ":/ *Some* ", it shows up. Why so?
[14:05] <wrik003> !
[14:05] <bhavin192> skat_sd, don't add extra space /Some
[14:05] <sayan> skat_sd: yes, becuase the first one has a comma
[14:06] <sayan> and the second one as a wild card
[14:06] <sayan> also the space
[14:06] <skat_sd> sayan, ignore the comma
[14:06] <skat_sd> typo
[14:06] <sayan> skat_sd: then space?
[14:06] <sayan> is that there?
[14:06] <skat_sd> Yes
[14:06] <skat_sd> Ohh, no space to be put. Got it
[14:06] <kushal> next
[14:06] <skarpy> !
[14:06] <vishami3> does gvim work same as vim and why is it build? Can i use it..?
[14:07] <kushal> vishami3, ..?
[14:07] <sayan> skarpy: can you fpaste the file?
[14:07] <kushal> vishami3, you can use gvim
[14:07] <skarpy> Sorry sayan ?
[14:07] <sayan> next
[14:07] <im_mohsin> kushal, Can you explain 'cw'? I'm not able understand clearly.
[14:07] <kushal> It has a graphical interface.
[14:07] <sayan> skarpy: oops that was for skat_sd
[14:07] <kushal> im_mohsin, Change the current word.
[14:07] <kushal> next
[14:07] <wrik003> sayan, the other day, why did you advise against using matrix, riot or irc bouncers? <eof>
[14:07] <vishami3> okay kushal
[14:08] <im_mohsin> it not working for me. kushal
[14:08] <kushal> im_mohsin, wait
[14:08] <im_mohsin> ok
[14:08] <sayan> wrik003: yes, because people rely on these applications, and then become ghost.
[14:08] <sayan> wrik003: they don't come online
[14:08] <vivek_> ciw might work. cw will change starting from the cursor
[14:08] <wrik003> sayan, ok, i see.
[14:08] <sayan> wrik003: they will never check the earlier logs
[14:08] <sayan> wrik003: it's always good to go slow
[14:09] <bhavin192> im_mohsin, it deletes the word and switches to insert mode
[14:09] <sayan> wrik003: matrix, riot, bouncers - I consider advanced, got it?
[14:09] <wrik003> sayan, yes.
[14:10] <kushal> im_mohsin, look at https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining
[14:10] <kushal> im_mohsin, tell me when you can see the terminal
[14:10] <sayan> im_mohsin: what is not happening? what happens when you do cw with cursor on a work?
[14:10] <sayan> s/work/word
[14:10] <sayan> next
[14:10] <skarpy> Suppose I have a particular word in my script that I want to replace with some other word, and this word is used in repetation, so all those similar words, how can I replace all at once?
[14:10] <sayan> skarpy: yes
[14:10] <skarpy> Using vim obviously
[14:10] <HoloIRCUser1> what is this ghost concept i am not getting it?
[14:11] <vivek_> skarpy: search and replace - google
[14:11] <im_mohsin> sayan, the cw actually deleting just the character
[14:11] <kushal> im_mohsin, Have you opened the URL I have given?
[14:11] <skarpy> vivek_: sorry? In vim?
[14:11] <meamitk> skarpy :%s/word/replace/g
[14:11] <im_mohsin> kushal, yes
[14:11] <sayan> skarpy: Larry and Sergey built tiny little website which contains everything. Try looking there
[14:11] <kushal> Can you see the terminal?
[14:11] <im_mohsin> yes
[14:11] <sayan> next
[14:12] <ashwanig> kushal, Is this the live terminal view that was to be introduced this year?
[14:12] <rkased> !
[14:12] <sayan> next
[14:12] <kushal> im_mohsin, can you see how cw changed the whole word?
[14:12] <rkased> Do you recommend using vimtutor? I think it is useful
[14:12] <kushal> next
[14:12] <skarpy> meamitk: 'word' is my original and 'replace' is my new word, right?
[14:12] <kushal> rkased, use anything you like.
[14:12] <rkased> ok
[14:12] <sayan> rkased: yes, people can use vimtutor, but again preferences
[14:12] <meamitk> skarpy yes
[14:13] <kushal> ashwanig, nope, we introduced it last year.
[14:13] <sayan> not everyone can learn from the same thing

[14:45] <rkased> As related to your suggestion of starting a blog about our experience related to this class, if I wanted to eventually build myself to make what I'm learning a career, what type of employment may I find myself in?
[14:45] <messifc> kushal, sure I will ask after session
[14:45] <kushal> rkased, depends on what you like to do?
[14:46] <kushal> rkased, I am using Fedora from core 1, that is around 2002-2003 days iirc.

[14:47] <kushal> rkased, For the last 3 years, it became my full time job, I get paid to have the same fun I used to have as a volunteer. This is one way to doing this as a career :)

[14:48] <kushal> next
[14:48] <soumam007_> kushal, if we are using fedora in vm then understanding the operating system,will it be a bit different than the original one?
[14:49] <ahole[m]> now when you have no idea of what content you want to write you could try something like this.
[14:49] <kushal> ahole[m], Have to say, that does not look like a blog.
[14:49] <kushal> soumam007, Not much, but if you actually do good things, you will have to move a bare metal installation for daily usage.
[14:49] <kushal> next
[14:50] <vishami3> what theme do you use the most in vim .. & why..?
[14:50] <wrik003> ahole[m] is a motor bike fan!

[14:50] <poojaencoded> sorry for late due to net issue

[14:50] <skat_sd> ahole[m], maybe you want to try writing something bigger ! Quotes are wow, though
[14:50] <kushal> I never knew that there is theme for vim.
[14:51] <soumam007_> kushal, i didnt understand 'bare metal imstallation'?
[14:51] <kushal> next
[14:51] <kushal> soumam007, Instead of a vm, directly install on the actual hardware

[14:52] <kushal> ahole[m], Now you are discussing other things.
[14:52] <vishami3> kushal : sorry i was supposed to write colorscheme !
[14:52] <soumam007_> yeah, i tried today! few problems are there ,i will sort it out soon
[14:52] <kushal> vishami3, I don't, I just use whatever it shows.
[14:52] <ahole[m]> kushal: Sorry got carried away!
[14:52] <kushal> next
[14:52] <kushal> People should try to write proper blog posts.
[14:53] <kushal> If you want to make random comments, twitter is a better place.
